            <p class="para-1">How Crafty Cureationz & Designs was formed?</p>
            <p class="para-2">My name is Autumn Mey and I have always enjoyed working on crafts of all kinds, even when I was a toddler (according to my mom), but I didn't start creating items to sell until later in life. I was making custom shirts, totes, cups of different kinds, bows, jewelry and blankets for friends and family as gifts and many of those people asked me why I wasn't selling my items. I responded with, "Well, I just never thought about it." Then came an order from a friend for some shirts and then a craft show vendor spot opportunity. I had so much fun making those items that I told myself that I wanted to make my passion become a business. So, I started thinking about business names. I've been involved with volunteering in the community since I was 14 and that was primarily with Susan G. Komen and Relay for Life, but many other organizations, too. Then it hit me. Crafty Cureationz. Yes, CUREationz. Why that? As the business grows, my goal is to donate 3% of sales to a non-profit organization helping those fighting cancer. I added '& Designs' when I started getting into books and digital downloads. Thus, creating the name Crafty Cureationz & Designs.</p>
            <p class="para-3">My oldest son helps me make most of everything. He's a very quick learner and he enjoys seeing the outcome of what he's made. My daughter helps me make the bows, or at least tries; sometimes I have to fix things, but hey, she's only 5 and she's honestly fairly good at even weeding vinyl. She gets so upset if she doesn't do something perfect.
                My youngest son, he's only 4, well, he just likes to pretend he's helping. Sometimes he will help peel off the transfer tape. Oh the excitement that is for him. They say it's the small things in life that make us happy.</p>
            <p class="para-4">Last, but certainly not least, my husband, Charles, and my mom. They are my biggest supporters. Of course, the hubby doesn't like having to spend money, but I keep telling him, "You gotta spend money to make money." He understands, and just goes with the flow; maybe he's thinking 'happy wife, happy life'. I don't know, but no matter what his thoughts are, he's always giving me ideas and opinions on items to make. My mom. I have learned so much from her in terms of owning a business. She owned her own business for 38 years, and I learned to KEEP RECEIPTS! Kidding. Well, kind of. I did learn that I have to keep all of my receipts, but I also learned great customer service skills, bookkeeping skills (for work, because I certainly can't do that at home), time management skills, and how to have a strong work ethic. Having those skills helped me with all of the management jobs I have previously held and those skills will continue to help me while I grow Crafty Creationz & Designs.</p>
            <p class="para-4">Thank you taking the time to read my bio. And please remember, each time you purchase from CC&D, a portion of the sale will be put aside to collectively donate to a cancer support agency.</p>
